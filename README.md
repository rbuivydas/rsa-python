# RSA Encryption and Decryption Tool using Python

## What is RSA?

RSA is an encryption method for securely communicating with individuals using asymmetric encryption where two different keys are used to cipher and decipher text, a public key and a private key. A public encryption key is used to generate ciphertext which is channelled through a communication channel to the desired individual. For the individual on the other end to be able to read the ciphertext, a private decryption key is required which can decrypt the ciphertext.
